# Starlink - 60 FPS Mod - Switch

Surprised to see that nobody made this for our Starfox pals.
Since you only get the starfox storyline from the Switch version.
Trying to play this at an unstable 30fps is such an eyesore, so I made this mod for emulators and the console.

## Requirements
- Base Game
- Game update 1.0.6
- Switch Emulator or Modded Switch Console

# Install Ryujinx
(Tested on Ryujinx 1.3.1 / Canary 1.3.37)
1. Download & Install Ryujinx: https://github.com/Ryubing/Stable-Releases/releases
2. After firmware/keys setup, right-click the game, Manage Title Updates and add update version 1.0.6
3. Download and Unzip my mod for Reujinx, right-click the game, Manage Mods and select the unziped folder
   Ex. 
5. Change your settings, CPU Tab, change CPU Mode to "Host (fast)", otherwise you'll crash more often it seems

<sub>(Don't use Yuzu/Suyu, tons of flickering/crashes)</sub>
